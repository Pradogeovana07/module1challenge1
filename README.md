When working on this website, my goal was to implement the following user story: 

## User Story
As a marketing agency,
I WANT a codebase that follows accesibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance criteria

It's done when a webpage meets accesibility standards.

WHEN I view the source code 

THEN I find semantic elements.

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

WHEN I view image elements

THEN I find accesible alt attributes.


## Usage

Web accessibilty is especially important for a business website. It ensures that any person that lands on a website can fully access any of the contents
despite of any disibilities. When I first viewed the code, there was a long list of divs and a lack of semantic elements.  I have refactored the existing 
code so that the site meets the accesibilty standards. The HTML follows a logical structure and includes alt attributes for all images. The CSS has been consolidated
and the entire codebase follows the Scout Rule for long-term sustainability. The web application has kept the existing apperance and has improved functionality.
