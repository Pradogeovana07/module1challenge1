When working on this website, my goal was to implement the following user story: 

*As a marketing agency,
I WANT a codebase that follows accesibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

##Acceptance criteria

*It's done when a webpage meets accesibility standards.

*When I view the source code; we find semantic elements.

*When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

*When I view image elements, I find accesible alt attributes.
